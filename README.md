## Overview

### The challenge

- Project Overview:
  - Build a weather forecast site using the WeatherAPI.
  - Implement location search and maybe the ability to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- API Integration:
  - Write functions to fetch weather data for a specified location.
- Data Processing:
  - Extract necessary information from the API response.
- User Interaction:
  - Set up a form for users to input their location.
- Display and Styling:
  - Display the weather information on the webpage.
  - Adjust the page look based on the weather data.
- Optional Enhancements:
  - Add a 'loading' component during API requests.
- General overview of challenge:
  - This project involves fetching weather data, processing it, and displaying it on a webpage. Users can input their location, and the page look changes based on weather conditions. Optional enhancements include a loading component and testing for low-end devices. Note the importance of API key security.
